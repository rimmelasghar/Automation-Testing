# Automation-Testing
We need websites to practice our test automation skills, wouldn’t you agree?
Where do you go when you need to learn how to deal with AJAX, Angular, Kendo, and other dynamic elements?
Hence, I compiled a list of my favorite websites to practice test automation:

    SauceDemo.com (web UI)
    ultimateqa.com/automation (web UI)
    Sample E-commerce mobile app (Android, iOS)
    Cypress Real World App (web UI)
    GitHub Users Search (web UI, API)
    Contact List Web and API (web UI, API)
    RealWorld demo apps (web, React, Angular, Vue, Elm…)
    Telerik Multi Language Demo Site (web UI)
    Webdriveruniversity.com (web UI)
    ACME Demo Banking (web UI)
    Dave Haeffner’s Practice Site (web UI)
    ParaBank Bank Site (web, API)
    Restful-Booker (API)
    JSONPlaceholder (API)
    HTTPBin.org (API)
    PetStore (API)
    E-commerce Clothing Site (web)
    Demoqa (web)
    Compendiumdev.co.uk (web)
    React shopping cart (React JS)

This list contains test automation websites that provide some unique attributes that other websites don’t have. As a result, you can pretty much combine all of them together to have a complete profile of different types of automation skills.
